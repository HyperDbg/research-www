# Exploring Fresh Reverse Engineering Techniques
{: .no_toc }

This article is about the new features to be introduced in the recent and future versions of HyperDbg, offering insights into their design/challenges and how they can benefit our reverse engineering endeavors by adding new reversing techniques.

## Abstract

This article explores the latest advancements and future updates in the HyperDbg debugger, a robust open-source tool designed for kernel-mode Windows debugging. It provides an in-depth analysis of new features aimed at enhancing reverse engineering techniques. The discussion begins with an overview of fundamental concepts like hypervisors and Intel's virtualization technology, establishing a foundational understanding. Key innovations in HyperDbg, such as event-driven debugging, event short-circuiting, and tracking function calls, are detailed. These features enable reverse engineers to gain deeper insights and exert finer control over the debugging process. Additionally, the article introduces methods for running processes without debug flags to improve transparency and circumvent anti-debugging mechanisms. Advanced techniques for detecting mode changes, intercepting memory execution, and analyzing system calls are presented, demonstrating the practical applications and significant potential of these new capabilities in real-world reverse engineering scenarios. 

The research highlights how these innovations can transform debugging practices, providing enhanced efficiency and effectiveness for security researchers and reverse engineers.
